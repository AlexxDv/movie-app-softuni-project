# Movie App Softuni Project

This is a simple React application that allows users to search for movies using the [TMDB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api). Users can search for movies by title and view details about individual movies.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository and install the required dependencies.

The application should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

When a user enters a search query, the app makes a request to the TMDB API and returns a list of matching movies and TV shows. 
The user can then click on a particular result to view more details about the movie, including the title, poster image, overview, and rating.

## Pages

The app has the following pages:

- Home page: Displays a list of popular movies.
- ADD page: Displays a list of movies that match the search query.
- Movie details page: Displays details about a selected movie.
- Login page: The Login page is where the user can enter their login credentials to access the app's features.
- Register page: The Register page is where the user can create a new account to access the app's features.
- Watch List page: The Watch List page is where the user can view a list of movies they have added to their watch list.
- Watched page: The Watched page is where the user can view a list of movies they have watched.
